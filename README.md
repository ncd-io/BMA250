Bosch Sensortecâ€™s BME250 is a triaxial, low-g acceleration sensor with digital output for consumer applications. It allows measurements of acceleration in three perpendicular axes. An evaluation circuitry (ASIC) converts the output of a micro-mechanical acceleration-sensing structure (MEMS) that works according to the differential capacitance principle. The Mini Module form factor delivered by NCD is ideal for rapid prototyping and hobbyist applications, employing a simple I2C connector to make this device more accessible on all computing platforms.
